== Biography

Wenting Ye is currently a junior student majored in network engineering at Beijing Univ. of Posts \& Telecoms. He has achieved excellent academic performance, including receiving three straight National Scholarships with overall GPA 91.68/100.
Before that, he studied in Fuzhou No.1 Middle School, where he was a member of Olympiad in Informatics (OI) team. He won the first prize in National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP).

He started his research in Sailing Lab in Oct 2016 with the mentor of [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/ Prof. Eric P. Xing] and [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~haohanw/ Ph.D. candidate Haohan Wang]. His main research interests include but are not limited to machine learning, data mining and computer vision.

Recently he has joined the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toutiao Toutiao AI Lab] as a research intern, focusing on building a video action recognition system.
