== Biography

Wenting Ye is currently a junior student majored in network engineering at Beijing Univ. of Posts \& Telecoms. He has achieved excellent academic performance, including receiving three straight National Scholarships with overall GPA 91.68/100.
Before that, he studied in Fuzhou No.1 Middle School, where he was a member of Olympiad in Informatics (OI) team. He won the first prize in National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP).

From Oct. 2016 to Oct. 2017, he worked with [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~haohanw/ Haohan Wang], a Ph.D. candidate at Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. In 2017 summer, he had a fantastic summer internship mentored by [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/ Prof. Eric P. Xing] and [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~haohanw/ Haohan Wang]. His main research interests include but are not limited to *machine learning* and its application in *data mining* and *computer vision*.

Recently he has joined the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toutiao Toutiao AI Lab] as a research intern, focusing on building a video action recognition system.

+He is looking for 2018 summer internship regarding machine learning in the U.S. If you have any positions available, please contact him!+
